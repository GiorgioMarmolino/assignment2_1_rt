Assignment 2, Part 1 - Project Documentation
============================================
Welcome to the documentation of the first part of the second project related to the Research Track 1 course.
In this project, a mobile robot moves in an environment of a 3D simulator in presence of edges and obstacles 
(given by walls); the goal of the robot is to reach the target position sent by the user.

This project has been developed starting from the original package of prof. Recchiuto:

'Original repository: <https://github.com/CarmineD8/assignment_2_2024>'

Two nodes have been developed by me:
-first node implements an action client, allowing the user to set a target (x, y) or to cancel it. It uses 
the feedback/status of the action server to know when the target has been reached. The node also publishes 
the robot position and velocity as a custom message (x,y, vel_x, vel_z), by relying on the values published 
on the topic /odom (odometry);
-second node implements a service node that, when called, returns the coordinates of the last target sent by 
the user;
